This hike will make you acutely aware of that as we cross the barrier multiple times. Ponder the state of urban planning in Toronto while admiring gridlocked traffic, road closures, and TTC replacement buses.
It gets better at the east end, where Toronto's newest neighbourhood is taking shape. If you haven't visited in the last few years, stunning buildings have sprouted up: the first mass timber building in Ontario, a Moshe Safdie condo, hip community centres, the LCBO HQ, and more.
Urbanism aside, we'll cover notable restaurants along the way. A lot of it is mediocre, overpriced tourist traps, or closed during the day. However, there are some decent choices for a quick bite.
The hike ends at another tourist hotspot: the historic Distillery District. It hosts various festivals throughout the year, notably the largest Christmas Market in Toronto. You can peruse it after the hike; this hike does not include exploration of the market.
There is no lunch break because we aim to reach the Christmas Market before 4pm, before free admission ends. Have a heavy breakfast or pick up munchies along the way.

Chinese food of course. Chinese restaurants are one of the few places that are open on Christmas. Join the secular tradition of checking out Chinese and other Asian cuisines.
The most compact place to graze is at downtown Chinatown. It started off where City Hall now stands, so I guess we can call that Chinatown Zero. It moved west to Spadina and continues as the oldest Chinatown in Toronto. It's also thriving, unlike other Chinatowns in North America. Some restaurants are comparable to the well-regarded spots in Scarborough, Richmond Hill, and Markham. There are also public art, historic houses, and other attractions in the neighbourhood.
This is the final installment in our Chinatown series. For reference, we've been to other Chinatowns in previous hikes.

If that isn't enough to entice you, what about big outlet stores and ethnic hypermarkets to fulfill your holiday shopping list?
Starting from the crescent-shaped road that gives Crescent Town its name, we'll descend to the ravine for a short jaunt through Taylor Creek Park. When we resurface, it's an urban hike all the way to the shopping mecca of Golden Mile. There aren't many notable restaurants along the way, but there are diverse food retail outlets. Great restaurants can be found at the end of the hike, in a booming halal food plaza.
There are several options for dinner: a Bangladeshi restaurant and sweets, south Indian vegetarian, or a new fusion Indian restaurant.

If the trails are icy, we'll go around Taylor Creek Park and use residential streets to get to O'Connor Drive.
How it worksHike starts punctually. Late or can't do the whole route? Meet us at scheduled checkpoints.
We'll browse many food places but won't linger long. See the route in advance, organize takeout, then pickup along the way.

Physicists often describe time as a fourth dimension that, alongside space, forms the fabric of spacetime, as outlined in Einstein鈥檚 theory of relativity. This framework suggests that time may be flexible, varying according to the speed and gravity influencing an observer, thus challenging our intuition of time as a steady, universal flow. Additionally, theories such as the block universe imply that past, present, and future coexist, questioning our perception of time as a linear progression.
Is time a physical dimension that exists independently, or is it simply a construct of human consciousness?
Can our subjective experience of time (such as time ""slowing down"" or ""speeding up"") tell us anything meaningful about its true nature?
In what ways might time and space be interdependent, and what does that imply for our understanding of either?
What are the implications of the block universe theory, where all moments in time coexist, on our experience of the present?
Could time have had a beginning, as some cosmological theories suggest, or has it always existed?

This event description may be a little shorter- the organizer was subject to meetup crashing after having written a whole description which was not saved - a learning experience. So simply the basics will be included here.
First, apologies for no walks for like, a month or two! It was a busy time, and it can feel less encouraging to plan events during the winter- though the weather has really been not bad; and we hope not to jinx it through scheduling this.
It would be beneficial to appreciate winter season in any case, seeing as that is Toronto for so much of the year. The season has its own beauties and charms of course.
***
This is planned to be a fairly simple little walk, one that we came up with ourselves in this group, in the East End. It passes through some parks, some pleasant residential neighbourhoods; and even some interesting and puzzling local artwork.
Last time, those on this walk (in the Spring) will I am sure recall that we even inadvertently ended up at ""Toronto's smelliest park"" to conclude the walk. This was unplanned and it is uncertain if we will seek to return there. The experience was rather aversive, as would be expected for HSPs, many of whom are already sensitive to smells. We can gauge interest on the day perhaps (joking).
We'll provide some more details of the walk if they arise before then. We will plan to meet just outside of Greenwood station, a typically low-key east end station (the only entrance is on Linnsmore ave., which we will meet in front of). We will pass through parks and neighbourhoods as alluded to. Should be nice to have a chance to walk and connect / re-connect with folks in our group again.
Also no pressure to talk more than you like, you can simply enjoy the silence and scenery on an evening walk in a part of the city that you may not (or may) have explored before. I hope this can be a nice way to unwind and perhaps meet new people on a weekend day.
***
Re: membership, since its nearly the end of the year, if you are a new member then the yearly $10 membership fee will cover this month as well as the entirety of 2025. If this is your first walk, kindly e-transfer to hsptorontomeetup@gmail.com prior to the day. Many thanks for supporting the group and helping me to cover meetup's organizer fees.
We will probably go rain or shine, but we'll monitor things closer to the day, to review whatever impending cataclysm (snow, wind, or hail) has been decided to coincide with our chosen walk day.
Very much looking forward to seeing new and old faces again :)",35,Max C.,Entertainment

Pages: 239Year: 2021
Synopsis:
In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humour and heart, she tells of growing up the only Asian-American kid at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother鈥檚 particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother鈥檚 tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the east coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, performing gigs with her fledgling band 鈥� and meeting the man who would become her husband 鈥� her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live.
It was her mother鈥檚 diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.
Some ground rules:- This is a women-only event.- Every attendee has to read the book before the meeting.- This is a safe place. Please be kind and respectful.-There is a $2 per meeting fee payable by cash. This is to help cover the costs of the Meetup organizer subscription.

SESSION DETAILSDick Moffat will demo an application he just completed that uses Excel in Windows to extract data from more than one data source (MS-Planner and from a Third Party On-Line Application using an Excel Add-In and also calling a REST API many times over) to Aggregate and consolidate their data, merge it all together into one group of Data Sets, and then publish that same data to Power BI to a single Data Mart and Report structure. ALL of this is done programmatically using Windows Task Scheduler as well as OneDrive and VBA and is repeatable multiple times daily.
Today clients keep insisting on using multiple third-party or in-house software solutions for different parts of their business, then they see a need to aggregate and summarize their data in a single place (such as Power BI).Dick will explain why much of this can actually be down behind your firewall using Excel in Windows using your own Excel skills and I will make an argument why this is at least a good near-term option for them and actually can act as a long-term one in most cases.
Dick believes that this type of solution will let companiesachieve their Dashboarding and Reporting results鈥� in a decent amount of time and at a justifiable cost - while giving the developer an acceptable return for their efforts. There are certainly other ways to accomplish this for sure but from Dick's research, he kept coming back to Excel and Power Query and VBA and will show you how to stage this and other related solutions in a corporation in a practical, inexpensive, and truly straightforward way compared to other potential alternatives.
ABOUT THE SPEAKERDick Moffat is a long-time spreadsheet and database developer with corporate clients worldwide and across many industries. His focus has always been on 鈥淪olutions鈥� to business requirements that call out for some form of structure, automation, and repeatability. To do this Dick becomes intimately familiar with the client鈥檚 business and is as much a business consult to them who uses technology to satisfy their needs.
Dick knows that business solutions mostly have a 鈥渟helf-life鈥� (although some don鈥檛) and so he has chosen to stay in Microsoft technology, as they have always in the end provided the technology he needs to deliver and maintain these applications for long term use.
Windows on the Client, Excel in Windows and Power BI, SQL Server and Azure Databases have been able to give him this kind of platform for decades now, and despite all the noise around us he really sees that continuing for many more years to come, or at least for the lifetime of any solutions built in the near future.
Dick believes WE can find a way to bring GREAT value from OUR skills that we have all worked so long to develop.

Join us for some casual, low stakes creative writing based on a collection of random prompts.
Structure of a meeting:
6-6:15:Say hi, grab a drink, get settled. Open up a blank document and banish your inner editor.
6:15-6:30:Prompts revealed! Time to get planning. Discuss the prompts with your fellows, or hunker down and start writing.
6:30-7:30:A hush falls over the group. We hunch like gremlins over our laptops and evil eye anyone who dares interrupt our focus. It鈥檚 time to engage in CREATION
7:30-8:30:Sharing and compliments! Add your work to the shared doc for everyone to read, or read out loud if you prefer. We will spend a few minutes on each story, heaping lavish praise upon one another. The goal is for each and every one of us to leave feeling like a badass and excited for the next time we sit down to write. (And also to slowly get used to sharing, which is terrifying.)
Group Norms:
This is NOT a critique group. If you choose to share, it should be a short piece written in response to the day鈥檚 prompts. We expect everything to be a messy first draft. Leave your red pens at home and come prepared to focus on the positives.
All genres welcome. All skill levels welcome. Queer-centric, allies welcome.
Please respect our venue by buying a drink and/or snack. They reserve seating for us in a busy cafe.

If you are not a beginner, you are still welcome to join but I鈥檇 like to know ahead of time so I can seat you with other people around your skill level. Therefore please be honest about your Japanese ability in your profile. I also run other meetups for higher levels.

Vegan Drinks is a social event for those interested in making new friends and meeting like-minded people. We meet up on the last Friday of the month. You don't have to be a vegan to come and enjoy the fun (in fact we encourage you to bring your veg and non-veg friends!), but only vegan food and drinks are available for purchase.
We start at 7pm, and the event runs till 10pm. There is no cover charge but we encourage everyone to support our host by buying some food and/or drinks! This month the event is being hosted by La Vegan Restaurant (https://www.laveganethiopian.com), they have some amazing Ethiopian grub so check out their food (https://www.laveganethiopian.com/food.php) and drinks (https://www.laveganethiopian.com/drinks.php) menus!
How does it work?
Come for the food, stay for the fun, and leave with new friends and fond memories. Name tags will be available so you won't have to remember a million names! Talk about your interests, your favourite recipes and restaurants, your dream job to save the animals, the environment, your ethics, or anything and everything.

Practical Philosophy is a weekly meet-up that brings critical thinkers together for an opportunity to dive deep on a topic, practice communicating, and building a community. All with no 鈥榦fficial鈥� philosophy knowledge required! 馃槑Practical Philosophy is based on the idea that philosophy should be accessible to all, and not something reserved only for academics. Each week we choose a topic, and the goal is to use the conversation to develop our critical thinking and communication as we explore that topic.The goal is to help develop our Critical Thinking, Communication, and Community 馃檶
馃摀 HOW DOES IT WORK?
Each week, we pick one topic and discuss it. The topic for the week is shared, generally in theWhatsapp group, along with jump-off points to get the conversation going.When groups get bigger than 7-8 people, it鈥檚 important that we break into smaller groups. This way we are able to maintain a conversational flow as opposed to having our meetups feel like a discourse or lecture.
General Meeting Agenda
Each Practical Philosophy meet-up follows this general timeline:
馃ЁPRICING?Practical Philosophy Club is FREE to attend! We just ask that if we are meeting in a caf茅, buy a beverage! Some chapters rent a space for us to meet, and they may ask for donations to help contribute to the cost of rent. Donations will always be 100% voluntary though!
馃挍 WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY
馃棧鈥淚 feel like Philosophy Club helps someone build their own belief system through a series of perspectives while not promoting what鈥檚 right and wrong鈥� - Ekam
馃棧 鈥淚 got hooked from day 1 (the topic was authority) and felt it was the right place for me. I feel it is a place where people can go to learn and discuss new perspectives and increase critical thinking and community by interacting with people who might challenge your point of views but at the same time encourage you to have openness and mind flexibility.鈥� - Daniel
馃 FAQ
No preparation is necessary. This isn鈥檛 a study of other thinkers. We want to know what you think about the topic, not what an old philosopher thought. If you have a perspective from a religion or a school of thought to share, throw it on the table and we鈥檒l discuss it.
The goal of our meet-ups is to not have dogmatic discussions, and flex our critical thinking muscles. Because of this, we want to hear from every realm of thought, and don't study a particular school.
Surprisingly, no! Although often, philosophy is seen as a Candelabra affair in a dark room with a bunch of guys, our Practical Philosophy meetups are generally 50/50 between genders, and we don鈥檛 meet in any dark rooms.
Of course you can, we encourage it :)
Please don't be! We do have a 15 minute grace period where we allow people to funnel in while we hang out, but after that if you arrive too late, it disrupts the flow of the conversation.
The location is posted in Meetup and ourWhatsappgroup for this location. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you join the Whatsapp group! If you want to know what other cities have a Practical Philosophy Club, you can see our chapters on ourwebsite.

OVERVIEW
Toronto is one of the most multicultural cities in the world. Take advantage of it with TorontoBabel! Many groups focus on one language, but this group provides an opportunity to practice many languages. At a regular TorontoBabel gathering we have native speakers of French, Spanish, English, Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, German, Polish, Italian, Cantonese, Turkish, Mandarin, Russian, Hindi, Arabic, Farsi and many other languages. Don't be shy! Learners of all levels, from beginner to native fluency are welcome!
HOW IT WORKS
TorontoBabel is a language exchange group. You can help people learn your native language and other members help you learn their native language. We usually have groups of people practicing French, Spanish, Korean, etc. and will show you where they are. If you are comfortable finding native speakers of your favourite language yourself, that's fine too!
If it's your first time attending a TorontoBabel event, please introduce yourself to our amazingEvent Organizers FARINAZ and TERRY. They will direct you to native speakers of the language you are interested in. They can also introduce you to people who want to learn your language.
QUESTIONS?
If you have any comments, questions, problems, concerns or ideas, just talk to the organizer about it. We will do our best to make sure you have a positive experience! Everyone is welcome!
Remember, this group is a hobby for us; we run it just for fun, we love it and we hope you will love it too!

You may get yourself a drink and then stand in a corner looking at others who are having a great time. You may not know how or don't feel comfortable opening a conversation with ladies or gentlemen you don't know. And then you leave without speaking to the people you would have liked to.
Does this happen to you? Don't be concerned as you are not alone. This is exactly how 90% of all people feel.
Now what if we transform this situation and give you a process where you can meet and connect with a large number of ladies and gentlemen in an organised and orderly manner?

- Rochelle will be hosting the evening and she will organize the fast friending process. She will indicate when you should move to the next person.
- From 8.30 onwards we will stop the system and people will have to chance go chat and interact with those they have met as well as others.If you are a bit shy or anxious then please come early. All attendees are also welcome to bring a lady friend along with them for free.

Vegans, vegetarians, or anyone who is interested in eating more plant-based are all welcome. For this event, everything will be fully vegan. 馃尡
Hot pot is a popular communal style of cooking and eating that originates from China, but has spread to many other East and Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam. It involves a large pot of simmering broth placed in the center of the table, and diners cook a variety of raw ingredients鈥攕uch as vegetables, tofu, mock meats, mushrooms, and noodles鈥攂y dipping them into the hot broth to cook them right at the table.
At Flower Lantern, they offer two different broths:
One pot is $44.99 (before tax/tip), and serves 2 people. Bring a friend along and share, or, if you鈥檙e comfortable sharing with other attendees, we will arrange people in pairs/groups beforehand.
Dedicated tongs and serving spoons will be used in the pots, and we will keep our personal utensils separate.
If you鈥檇 like to attend, and not join the hot pot, the rest of the menu will also be available.
The event will start at 6:00pm and we will start sorting out the pairs/groups for the hot pots around 6:15pm.
Vegan hot pot is difficult to find in Toronto, so I was ecstatic to see it being offered at Flower Lantern. It really hits the spot as the weather gets colder. Come join the tradition, while getting to know the veg community!",24,Michelle,Entertainment

There are those who believe that our thoughts and actions are fully determined by internal and external causes and free will is an illusion. Everything we do is somehow predetermined.
But this is totally contrary to how most people feel about their ability to make free choices and determine their own actions, rather than reacting passively to outside forces.
This topic is hotly debated in the fields of psychology, biology, physics, religion and philosophy. And on Tuesday December 10th the Toronto Debating Society will attempt to grapple with this complex and fascinating subject.
As always, the debate will be followed by a lively discussion in the neighborhood pub.
We hope you will join us at 7:30pm on Tuesday, December 10th, in theFriends House, at 60 Lowther Avenue, Torontofor our last debate of 2024**.**

For instance, Is it possible that a definitive measurement is made while the overall state of the system and the apparatus remain in a superposition? (Including whatever one might call observers)?
The standard classical rules of inference fail here and he will discuss a recent quantum optical proof of principle demonstrating this fact. Prof. Vedral will also talk about more realistic experiments to test which parts of our perception rely on quantum features. Some of them are straightforward, such as testing our sensitivity to the intensity of light, its polarization, and sensitivity to different states of light by a single human observer.
Then, there are conceptually more interesting and experimentally more challenging questions. Can a human entangle two emitting dipoles (atoms, molecules etc) just by observation? Can a human observation execute a Bell state measurement that leads to teleportation of a state of light to another human?
Can 鈥渙bservers of observers鈥� (a la Wigner) consciously know about their detection of entanglement between other observers and the observed, while these observers themselves are not conscious of the observation in the first place?
Bio:Vlatko Vedral (PhD and BSc at Imperial College) is a professor of quantum information at University of Oxford. He has published over 400 research papers on various topics in quantum physics and quantum computing and is one of the Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers. He has given numerous invited plenary and public talks during his career. These include a specialised talk at a Solvay meeting (2010) and a popular one at the International Safe Scientifique (2007). He was awarded the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2007, the World Scientific Medal and Prize in 2009, the Marko Jaric Award in 2010 and was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics in 2017 and a member of the European Academy of Sciences in 2020. He is consulting the World Economic Forum on the Future of Computation. Dr. Vedral is the author of 4 textbooks and 2 popular books (鈥淒ecoding Reality鈥� and 鈥淔rom Micro to Macro鈥�). He gives regular interviews to the media and is actively engaged in popularization of physics also by writing for New Scientist, Scientific American and major UK and overseas newspapers.

Please bring a wrapped book (new or gently used), with a few words of description written on the outside. This is optional, but it's a fun way to get a book you never might have picked up.
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo:
Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?
Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.
Summoned to Evelyn鈥檚 luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the 鈥�80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn鈥檚 story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique鈥檚 own in tragic and irreversible ways.",44,Melis T.,Entertainment

Join me for an hour of getting worked on. Once a month, on the last Friday of the month, I will be hosting an online group event where I will clear you of energy you have picked up that does not belong to you. It is so easy to pick up energy (vibration) that does not belong to you. If you: work in a stressful job situation, spend time with people who are stressed, fearful or angry, take the subway or are a practitioner and work with people on a daily basis you may have attracted some of it. Just by the fact that it is not yours, it is non beneficial, but some of it can be painful or disorienting. Some of the signs that you have some ""company"", or energy that is not yours, are: feeling spacey, not able to focus being very tired for no apparent reason, mood shifts and sharp jabbing pain. Join me once a month to get clear.",8,Diane Y.,Entertainment

It'sFrank Sinatra's birthday, born December 12, 1915, so let's celebrate the musical legacy of Ol' Blue Eyes - The Chairman of the Board.Our music history livestream program will play video selections from Frank Sinatra's best musical and film performances along with commentary on his fascinating life and career.During our program you'll have an opportunity to discuss the music with your fellow attendees via Zoom.
Frank Sinatra(December 12, 1915 - May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra then found success as a solo artist becoming the idol of the ""bobby soxers"".Sinatra released a string of successful albums and was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname ""Ol' Blue Eyes"".Sinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor and led a colorful personal life, including turbulent affairs with many women.Frank Sinatra continues to be seen as iconic figure in music, film and popular culture.

+++++++++++++++++About the North York Physics Group (NYPG)
NYPG was established in 2007 and now has almost 1,900 members.
Our presentations provide a venue for learning from members and guestacademics and scientists. We also have video lectures covering on all aspects of Physics.
We encourage our members to submit presentations or help us find great Physics presenters, whether they be professional academics, post-grads, or just physics enthusiasts.
Within our 3 hour +/- meetup, each member gets to learn and discuss many aspects of Physics.
The only ""formal"" qualifications you need to join is a sincere personaldesire and enthusiasm for Physics; to keep yourself informed and tocourteously share your insights.
BTW: Some members have asked if we will be going back to in person meetings. That would be nice, but, many of our regular attendees are at too much of a distance, or prefer not travelling, so the virtual meetings work well. However, we are looking into possible hybrid meetings meaning an appropriate free meeting space with reliable internet service is a must.
In the meantime, we are having a few in-person informal meetings just to meet and catchup. We hope to see you there!
Mohsen and I would like to thank our Organizing Team: Linda, Dan, Larry, Vera and Avo for their past and present dedicated support of NYPG. Thank you TEAM!

After introducing the concept of and need for survival analysis methods, we will first discuss how to format a dataset properly to conduct a survival analysis, including working with dates, calculating date differences, and coding events and censoring. Then, we will learn how to perform basic survival analyses in R including plotting Kaplan-Meier curves and fitting Cox regression models. We will discuss the proper ways to interpret the results, and some of the common ways survival analysis results are mis-interpreted.

Goodreads Description:Helen Kent never dares to step outside her comfort zone. She lives a lonely, mundane life in the city, grinding through her uninspiring marketing job. That is, until a spontaneous online purchase brings her to the little bay town of Oban, Scotland, where a 500-year-old cottage full of secrets and stories awaits her. After Helen unearths the local legend of a 16th century witch, she discovers a set of mysterious journals in the cottage鈥檚 library. Thrust into a world of magic she doesn鈥檛 understand, she soon realizes there are both light and dark forces at work beyond her control. With the help of a dashing Scottish neighbor and his wise grandfather, Helen discovers the link that connects her to the mysterious events unfolding at the cottage. But when the past collides with the present, she must face her fears and fight for what she believes in鈥攖hat is if she hopes to unravel the mystery of Fernbeg cottage before darkness descends, again.",39,Jessie Antoine .,Business

Do we have a genuine interest in learning about the experiences of Chinese Canadians from different origins and migration histories, or are we more inclined to connect with those who share similar backgrounds?

Is the shared experience of being part of the diaspora the only commonality between Chinese Canadians from different backgrounds?

NB: Registration required.,"789 Yonge Street 路 Toronto, ON","This Saturday Dec 7th, DIYBio.to welcomes you to an offsite hands-on PCR workshop! No experience necessary. This is meant to be a fun and informative exploration of PCR, which is the cornerstore tech of molecular biology.
Course Description:Basic PCR protocol for Standard PCR and some Real-time qPCR. Learn to micropipette and set up PCR reactions.
Expectations and goals:Learn what PCR is and how to perform it.DNA amplification using short DNA oligonucleotides, an enzyme to copy the DNA strands, and amplify them by attaching the nucleotides that correspond to the opposite strand. Given a set of primers that is well defined for the specific target, the method is fairly straightforward on paper, but requires attention to detail in practice. Using a Taq mix, the primers and mix are added together. Making Taq mixes from scratch is also possible, and requires utmost care in the preparation 鈥� keeping all DNA samples away from the preparation site. The next step is adding the template or test sample, and setting up the PCR machine. Afterwards, we will also run a gel.
This class will be limited to a select few people, as we can only train a small number of people at once. We also welcome you to chat about biology, biotech, scientific approaches. While this is a free event, donations to keep our projects well supplied are welcome!
AtDIYBio.to, our mission is to bridge the gap between biology and the community, fostering a reciprocal relationship where people can reconnect with the wonders of biology. Operating in a neutral, open, and not-for-profit environment, we are dedicated to making biology accessible.
Who we are: Our community comprises biologists and enthusiasts, ranging from individuals with a keen interest to PhD-level scientists and engineers.
Code of Ethics: We adhere to the DIYBio code of ethics, as outlined on diybio.org.

(18-35/Drink Offer/Bring Lady FREE),"2827 Dundas St W 路 Toronto, ON","Picture this- You want to meet new people. You want to widen your social circuit and meet new ladies and gentlemen who could be your friends. You go to social venues where lots of ladies and gents socialise but you are a bit nervous and unsure about starting a conversation with a complete stranger. You may get yourself a drink and then stand in a corner looking at others who are having a great time. You may not know how or don't feel comfortable opening a conversation with ladies or gentlemen you don't know. And then you leave without speaking to the people you would have liked to.
Does this happen to you? Don't be concerned as you are not alone. This is exactly how 90% of all people feel.
Now what if we transform this situation and give you a process where you can meet and connect with a large number of ladies and gentlemen in an organised and orderly manner?
'Fast friending' is our fun and quick way to help you make new connections quickly with both ladies and gentlemen. These are people in the age group of 18 and 35 and so you will be on a similar wavelength.
Here鈥檚 how our Fast Friending works:-- We will meet at 7.00 and have time to get settle down and get a drink.FREE POOL from 8 to 9 pm. Finger food and drinks at a discount for all members under Happy Hours!
- From about 7.30 to 8.30 we will run the fast friending system. Half of the group (mixed gender) will stay in a fixed place and the other half of the group (mixed gender) will be asked to rotate. During these intervals, each pair of people will get the opportunity to talk to each other.
- Susi will be hosting the evening and she will organize the fast friending process. She will indicate when you should move to the next person.
- From 8.30 onwards we will stop the system and people will have to chance go chat and interact with those they have met as well as others.If you are a bit shy or anxious then please come early. All attendees are also welcome to bring a lady friend along with them for free.
Click below to book your ticket online today and save money! -Speed Friending with Susi 14th December!
Our venue for the evening -Shox's Billiard Bar is spacious, has comfortable seating and not very noisy. We have a reserved area where our members can meet each other in a supportive environment.
- We are not a close knit tight group. Our evenings are warm and comfortable for members attending for the first time and those coming alone. You will not feel alone!
- We have many groups in this city. Members of our other groups who RSVP are included as guests of the organisers in order to give you an indication of expected people.
- This evening is for ladies and gents in the 18 to 35 age group. While some will be at the younger end of this range there will also be others at the other end of the range and lots in-between!
- We are not a dating group. Our events are not organised to manage your dating life. Please do not attend our event if a perfect gender balance is important for your enjoyment of our meet-up.

Welcome to our inclusive American Sign Language (ASL) practice group! We want to emphasize that while we're excited to have participants of all ASL proficiency levels, we do not offer formal ASL instruction.To make the most of your time with us, it's essential for ASL learners to have some basic knowledge.(You can find valuable resources below to help you get started).
Our gatherings are designed for a diverse group, including native ASL speakers, teachers, interpreters, students, and those with at least a basic grasp of the ASL alphabet and a few fundamental signs. Whether you're a seasoned signer or just starting your ASL journey, we encourage you to join us!
Our primary goal is to have a good time communicatingwithout the use of our voices. In the event of a large turnout, we may divide into smaller groups to ensure clear face-to-face conversations. Remember that perfection in ASL is not required; our group is about learning, enjoying ourselves, and refining our ASL skills while providing mutual support.
To stay updated and informed about any changes to our events, don't forget to join our Meetup group. We're thrilled to either meet you for the first time or see familiar faces, all while practicing ASL together.

The purpose of this event is to meet up to play heavier / longer board games, and have fun while doing it! We will start off small and if there is sufficient interest we will add capacity for future events.
You are welcome to bring your own games to the event, or join a game someone else is hosting.
Scheduling details:- This week, we are hosting the event away from the Guild House. They have an evening event scheduled, which means we wouldn't be able to stay long, plus availability of the large tables will be limited- At our substitute location this weekend, which will be hosted at the Dining Room at my condo building. We will have access to large tables for all games, and comfortable seats. Our hours will be limited, based on how long a single event can be scheduled for, but should be enough to play 1-3 full length games- If you have a specific game that you would like to post for, feel free to do so in comments. In your post, include the name of the game, number of players needed for the game, whether you are offering a teach or not, and the start time- If you would like to join a specific game that has already been posted, feel free to comment on it confirming your participation. Make sure you have noted the details posted by the host- You are of course also welcome to organize / join games onsite on the day itself, assuming sufficient players / tables are available
Available Amenities:- Food and drinks arenotavailable on-site as this is a private residence building. Please bring your own food and drinks based on your plans. A microwave and refrigerator is available to temporarily store food / heat food as needed.- 1-2 Volunteers to help set up the tables at the start, and clean up at the end of the event would be greatly appreciated. Should not take more than 5 minutes on either end!
Admission Fee:- There is no fixed fee. However, the room has a booking fee of $30, which will be split between attendees. Plan for a $5 per head share, but this number will reduce the more attendees we have.",3,Error,Entertainment

The novel follows the story of Genly Ai, a human native of Terra, who is sent to the planet of Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, a loose confederation of planets. Ai's mission is to persuade the nations of Gethen to join the Ekumen, but he is stymied by a lack of understanding of their culture. Individuals on Gethen are ambisexual, with no fixed sex; this has a strong influence on the culture of the planet, and creates a barrier of understanding for Ai.

You watch others find their partners and wonder when it is going to be your turn.
I've met and spoken to hundreds of singles who are over being single, but unsure how to change things.
My FREE 90 minute workshop aims to get you on the path by giving you a framework to help you shift your thinking, and in doing so, create a different way of being to attract your ideal partner.
This workshop is for conscious singles who are ready to do things differently to attract their ideal match.
In this 90 minute workshop, I will teach you to:
-Become aware of what is holding you back
-Learn why you are repeating the same patterns
-Gain an understanding of what it takes to make the shift.
I teach what I have successfully created in my own life. I was single in my late 30s, having just recovered from several years with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Within six months of recovering, after applying these teachings, I attracted my dream man.
We got married less than a year and a half later (when I was 40) and at 41 we had our son who is now 7 years old.
My clients are achieving huge success too. Many have met their soulmates, and many reports that they have cleared their ""stuff"", opened their hearts, and are feeling beyond excited about this aspect of life, knowing their ideal partner is very close.
My recent client Nadine was 46 years old, wondering if her man would ever turn up. She joined my program and in just over a year, she was married to the most wonderful man. She attributes her success to our work together.
This workshop is for you if:
路 You are tired of being single and ready to find a partner who will appreciate you for you.
路 You are over-dating the wrong people.
路 You are questioning if they even exist, or wondering if all the good ones are taken
路 You are over the dating sites and putting yourself out there
路 You are ready to meet ""him"" (or her).
At the 90 minute workshop, you will:
- Understand your personal story, its importance, and how it impacts how you view relationships
- Appreciate the importance of raising your energy and how this helps you align and attract all that you want
- Learn what is required to attract the type of partner you are wanting
- Plus, find out the shortcuts to go from a theoretical understanding to an embodied experience so you can raise your relationship vibration to feel good and bring him in more quickly.
Look forward to seeing you there.
Love Deb x",40,Deb M.,Business

Will your holiday season change if you met just one special person who truly brightens your day? Will your New Year be transformed if you meet more wonderful people? Could they be your next best friend, your future life partner, your next employer, or your next business partner?
'Festive Fast Friending' is our magical Christmas-themed social evening designed to help you make new connections quickly with both ladies and gentlemen. These are people in the age group of 21 to 49, so you'll be on a similar wavelength. Naturally, you can always choose who to speak with based on your preference!
Tanya, your Christmas host, will be there to welcome you warmly into the group with some festive cheer and help you with introductions!
We welcome locals and internationals both to join our Christmas celebration!

Here's how our Festive Fast Friending works:-- We will meet at 7:00 PM in our beautifully decorated venue, with time to settle down and enjoy a complimentary mulled wine or hot chocolate.- From about 7:30 to 8:30 PM, we will run the fast friending system. Half of the group (mixed gender) will stay by their Christmas-themed table settings, and the other half (mixed gender) will rotate. During these intervals, each pair will get the opportunity to chat and share their favorite holiday memories.- Tanya will be hosting the evening and organize the fast friending process with festive bell chimes to indicate when you should move to the next person.- From 8:30 PM onwards, we'll stop the system, and people can mingle freely while enjoying Christmas canap茅s and seasonal music.- From 8:30 to 9:30 PM, we have a FREE Christmas party dance session, where you can learn some classic party moves perfect for the holiday season!
If you're a bit shy or anxious, please come early. Tanya will help you meet other members in a small group, perhaps over some warm mulled wine, and help you settle down and get comfortable.
All attendees are welcome to bring a lady friend along with them for free. This will make it a lot less stressful as you'll always have your friend alongside.
We have Happy Hours until 8 PM with special Christmas cocktails!
Our venue for the evening - Shoxs Billiard Bar. We have a reserved area where our members can meet each other in a supportive environment and holiday ambiance.
- We are not a close-knit tight group. Our evenings are warm and welcoming for members attending for the first time and those coming alone. You won't feel like the Grinch!
- We have many groups in this city. Members of our other groups who RSVP are included as guests of the organisers to give you an indication of expected people.
- This evening is for ladies and gents in the 21 to 49s age group. While some will be at the younger end of this range, there will also be others at the other end of the range and lots in-between!
- We are not a dating group. Our events are not organised to manage your dating life. Our group is created to help ladies and gents meet other like-minded people. Please do not attend our event if a perfect gender balance is important for your enjoyment of our meet-up.

Step into the world of Napoleonic France, a time of extraordinary transformation and ambition that reshaped not only France but the entire European continent. Let's talk about the rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, a military genius and political reformer who rose from the chaos of the French Revolution to become Emperor of the French. Under his leadership, France experienced sweeping changes in governance, law, society, and its role on the world stage, all while embroiled in relentless conflict during the Napoleonic Wars. We鈥檒l examine how Napoleon's vision for empire clashed with the ideals of the Revolution, his controversial leadership style, and the profound impact of his policies and conquests on Europe and beyond.

Tickets are expensive, so I've opted to buy a 'Selfie ticket' for $126.50 (these seats are mid way to top of 300s sections). They are also BLUE coloured dots on the map. The price is reduced because they are single tickets through Ticketmaster and the system allows only 1 ticket purchase (I tried for a 2nd one separately and failed!).You will need to buy your own ticket through this link: ticketmaster.ca/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-toronto-ontario-12-31-2024/event/100060FFAE1438E0

Building on 鈥渓ivability,鈥� a word coined by a 19th century English doctor, Edward Johnson, to depict 鈥渢he aptitude or fitness to live,鈥� the talk considers livability as a distinct normative space for us to understand who we are as creatures that are fundamentally disconnected with their physiology. In the history of Western political thought, there appears to be an assumption that the body is simply there. Yet that body cannot simply be taken for granted because it needs air, food, water, and shelter. In other words, the body is not a self-contained entity.
The talk argues that taking care of the physical body is by definition a political question as it involves being in an environment where necessities can be secured. To address the problematic, the talk turns to a key concept in Confucianism, which is self-cultivation. The self in this term is the moral character of a person. By looking at the etymology of the two Chinese characters that make up the term, the talk posits a normative framework that puts the body squarely as the starting point of being; without which neither the cultivated person nor the right-bearing individual can thrive.

Note: This is a talk with audience Q&A presented by the University of Toronto's Centre for Ethics that is free to attend and open to the public. Refreshments will be served at the event. Sometimes we look for each other after the talk for further discussion about the topic.
The talk will also be streamed online with live chat here [to be posted]
About the Centre for Ethics (http://ethics.utoronto.ca):
The Centre for Ethics is an interdisciplinary centre aimed at advancing research and teaching in the field of ethics, broadly defined. The Centre seeks to bring together the theoretical and practical knowledge of diverse scholars, students, public servants and social leaders in order to increase understanding of the ethical dimensions of individual, social, and political life.
In pursuit of its interdisciplinary mission, the Centre fosters lines of inquiry such as (1) foundations of ethics, which encompasses the history of ethics and core concepts in the philosophical study of ethics; (2) ethics in action, which relates theory to practice in key domains of social life, including bioethics, business ethics, and ethics in the public sphere; and (3) ethics in translation, which draws upon the rich multiculturalism of the City of Toronto and addresses the ethics of multicultural societies, ethical discourse across religious and cultural boundaries, and the ethics of international society.
The Ethics of A.I. Lab at the Centre For Ethics recently appeared on a list of 10 organizations leading the way in ethical A.I.: https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/10-organizations-leading-the-way-in-ethical-ai",9,TPM,Entertainment

This is the end of an era.
The very last Rathnelly Tour is today December 8, 2024. This tour will be available, but only through private tours. It will also be incorporated into other tours that just touch on the history of this important area of Toronto. This historic tour has been around for 3 years, and has surprised so many Torontonians, including myself, read on and find out why.
In order to make room for another 520newtours that are in the back of my brain trying to get out, it's time to retire some of the older ones!
Good Bye Rathnelly it's been a slice!
The world must be spinning in the wrong direction. Something is amiss. I failed to know a fact about Toronto. Wow! Didn't know this little fact about our beloved Toronto.
Ok let's see if I can make this clear. It's a fascinating story about a fascinating district of Toronto.
The first settlers divided the area that would become South Hill into residential plots. This activity started in and around 1793, including the land given to Peter Russell. That's where Russell Hill Road comes into the picture. So far so good! Everyone on board? Ok perfect!
The wealthiest citizens of Toronto built large mansions that included John Macdonald's Oaklands, the Eaton's Ardwold, Glenedyth, Spadina, Casa Loma, and outrageously beautiful Rathnelly.
Toronto annexed the area beginning in 1905. The southeastern section of South Hill is known as Rathnelly from the former ""Rathnelly,"" house built in 1830. But now this is where things get a little like mud on a rainy day in April in York. All downhill from here!
On July 1, 1967, the Rathnelly neighbourhood declared itself an independent republic from Toronto and Canada. Excuse me! Say that again! And a little louder, it proclaimed independence from Canada! Ok then.
The Republic of Rathnelly celebrates with a party in June, referred to as ""Rathnelly Day.""
Well OK then! Interesting fact about Toronto. And I called myself a Toronto expert...............
And just for fun you might want to check out this cool video about Rathnelly, it's Toronto history at its all time best!Have a look at this link,
https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/916491843661/
This walk is for all walking levels and fitness skills. Please dress for the season and bring water. And remember to bring your love of history as well. Hope to see you there.
This walking tour begins and ends at Timothy Eaton Memorial Church at 230 St. Clair Avenue West. We return to the starting point after the walk!
This tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person.

About the book:In this short story, Baldwin explores the relationship between two brothers in Harlem, one of whom, Sonny, is a jazz musician struggling with addiction. Told from the perspective of the older brother, the narrative grapples with the themes of suffering, artistic expression, and the search for redemption.

All ages and levels of players from intermediate to advanced are encouraged to attend.
ABOUT THE TORONTO GUITAR SCHOOL'S JAM NIGHTS
Due to our location, right in the heart of the biggest music scene in the country, as well as our access to top of the line equipment for performance and recording, the Toronto Guitar School is uniquely positioned to offer incredible jamming opportunities for the Toronto music community. The Toronto Guitar School also has been running our highly popular Rock Band and Ensemble program for over 10 years.
If you are new to our Open Jam Nights please arrive early (10-15 mins prior / 5:45 PM) so we can assess your skill level and musical interests in order to place you with musicians of similar skill level and stylistic preference. A brief audition ensures that you are matched with like-minded and amicable band members so that no time is wasted playing in a group that is either too basic or advanced for you. Our Open Jams occur on a monthly basis at our facility for the nominal fee of $10 for Toronto Guitar School or Mint Music Members and $15 for those not connected with the school. The jam is very well organized and runs a total of 2 hours in multiple rooms that are perfectly outfitted with everything you will need to rehearse and make great music together.
OPEN JAM SCHEDULE
6:00 PM 鈥� Orientation and Auditions. For those who have already attended our Open Jams or participated in our Band program you can immediately proceed to our band rehearsal rooms and start jamming with others.
8:00 PM 鈥� Open Jam ends
INSTRUCTOR INVOLVEMENT
The bands that are formed in our open jam nights are intended to function in a self-directed fashion with people sharing the chair for certain instruments (i.e. guitar and bass) so that everyone gets a chance to play. For ease of convenience we have binders with music charts for each specific instrument (e.g. piano, guitar, bass, drums, voice, saxophone, trumpet, ukulele etc.) to make it easier to play the tunes together. We are constantly updating and improving our song lists so if there is a piece you think should be added to our rehearsal binder please let us know and we will do our best to add it in time for the next session.
While music instructors will be present at the jam, they are not there to direct the Open Jam, assign songs, or any other heavy handed roles. Instructors are present at the event in case that a musician or band should want advice or assistance and to make sure things run smoothly without technical glitches or any other major issues.
WHAT IT COSTS
If you are already a student of Mint Music or The Toronto Guitar School the discounted rate for the Open Jam is $10. This amount is paid upfront before you enter any of our three rehearsal rooms. Each participant gets a wrist band and can stay as little or as long as they like. You will find that we have many people participating in our jam nights so please bring exact change to speed up the payment process. If you are not a student of Mint Music or the Toronto Guitar School the Open Jam will cost $15. This fee helps go to covering the cost of the rooms, upkeep of equipment, and instructor fees for the evening.
WHO CAN PLAY?
Our Open Jam is accessible to all ages. Our band program is primarily geared to adults but if you are a teen we do have a teen band so please contact the school office in advance so we can be sure to connect you to other teens your age at the jam.
PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES
The Toronto Guitar School is proud to organize three live band showcases each year open to our students. A full PA, backline, and sound engineer are provided by the school, again at no extra cost to participants. Our last major showcase was held at the Jazz Bistro in Toronto. Some of our bands even pursue their own performance opportunities outside of the school鈥檚 involvement.
RECORDING OPPORTUNITIES
The Toronto Guitar School features a top of the line recording studio that bands can use to record demos, and bands have also used our facilities to record professional music videos.",6,Glen A.,Entertainment

**We will join our good friends at Small World Music, and enjoy this concert in their intimate venue (just 100 seats)
Tickets are $22. The purchase link is below.
https://www.honeypawband.com/
In this concert,Honeypawwill be presenting material from wax cylinders recorded by the folklorist A.R.Niemi, who travelled to several villages in Lithuania over one hundred years ago to collect archaic songs. His plan was to conduct comparative studies of Finnic and Baltic texts, however he realized that he first had to collect the very first printed examples of Lithuanian polyphonic songs, or sutartines.
During a trip to Finland in May 2023,Honeypawvisited the archives of the Finnish Literature Society and obtained copies of the unpublished wax cylinder recordings made by Niemi. Their October tour of Lithuania included shows in Nemun臈lio Radvili拧kis, Valkininkai and Marcinkonys, where the material was recorded. This show is the project finale, where they will share their adventures and favourite tunes. This project is supported by the Lithuanian Council for Culture.
Honeypaw is the Toronto-based experimental folk duo of Jurgita Zvinklyte and Matti Palonen, formed after Jurgita moved to Canada in 2019. Since then, they have been performing traditional songs in Lithuanian, Finnish, and Karelian in Canada and Europe. They play traditional instruments including kantele, jouhikko, and skudu膷iai, blending them with modern soundscapes and rhythms.

Christmas and the season of giving is about to get under way. We are all in good high spirits should we say, or are we? At this time of year let's dive under the covers of night, and reveal what is truly hidden at this fun time of the year!
Haunted Toronto. Indeed. Scary stories of old York. Bloody York. Murder and mayhem.
And at this time of year when the chill cools the blood, and hot cocoa and stockings are hung by the fireplace with great care, stories of the truly brutal come out. And this walk is like no other. The only difference is it might snow!
Tales of hauntings from the U of T, Hospital Row, and the Financial District make this a spooky event for the upcoming Christmas season. Come and enjoy the walk, if you survive that is to open your gifts on Christmas morning.
This walking tour is for all fitness levels and skills. Please dress for the weather. This Halloween walking tour begins at the Queen's Park SUBWAY Station at the southwest corner of University Avenue and College Street in front of theTim Horton's Cafe.
This tour has a ticket price of $15.00 per person.

Combining market intelligence&employee voice for what's ahead,"109 West 39th Street, New York, NY 10018 路 New York, NY","2025 is shaping up to create a complex discourse in and about the workplace. Business-friendly labor policies are colliding with employee expectations. Immigration restrictions threaten to create skills shortages. Unions face uncertainty. Changes to overtime laws, reproductive care access, RTO mandates, and DEI programs are creating tension. Add to this the anxiety about AI transforming 鈥� or even eliminating 鈥� entire occupations. Headlines predict workforce upheaval, but what's really happening on the ground?
Like the data we collect, we have a choice: remain passive observers of change, or actively engage with the insights. How do we cut through the noise and replace fear with facts? How do we build an early warning system that transforms passive market intelligence and active employee feedback into actionable insights? What signals truly matter? Where should organizations focus their response?
Market data tells one story. Employee sentiment tells another. People Analytics sits at this intersection, uniquely positioned to separate signal from noise and identify where organizations can make meaningful impact 鈥� serving both people and profits. When we combine real workforce intelligence with authentic employee voice, we replace speculation with insight, anxiety with understanding, and paralysis with action.
To bridge these perspectives and help us prepare for what鈥檚 to come in 2025 we bring together two voices representing organizations that study these trends closely:
Join us as we close out 2024, celebrating the year's end in our traditional style while actively preparing for the changes ahead. Because in the face of transformation, the choice between staying passive or taking action makes all the difference.

Millions of people across the country are struggling to find affordable homes, while an ongoing labor shortage is stalling construction projects nationwide, further driving up costs. Two of the most pressing issues of our time have governments across the country scrambling for solutions. The federal government aims to significantly boost home construction nationwide, with a goal of 3.9 million new homes by 2031. Increasing supply is intended to cool the overly expensive housing market, however there is an elephant in the room 鈥搘ho will build all these new homes?To meet demand, we must embrace innovation and technology to reshape how 鈥� and who 鈥� will build the homes of tomorrow. Without a fundamental systemic shift, the gap between demand and supply will only widen. The solution lies in robotics and equipping the next generation of construction workers with the skills to run them.
Bio:
Nhung Nguyen is the CEO of Horizon Legacy, where she is transforming a seven-decade-old company into a leader in construction technology and robotics. Nhung has over 15 years of experience developing complex infrastructure projects valued at $150M and supported Horizon Legacy's pioneering move into renewable energy development.

It will be fromSaturday July 18th to Saturday July 25th leaving from Vancover. This is a must do, bucket list and once in a life time trip!
We will be sailing with they luxury Holland America cruise line which was the first cruise line to sail in Alaska and in 2022 they celebrated their 75th anniversary in Alaska. This is a don't miss trip.
FUN FACT!:Mathew has also worked for Holland America Line, knows the ships and even worked a summer sailing in Alaska. Know's the in's and outs.
The reason why we are starting this early for this crusie is because it is one of the most expensive 7-Day cruises which cost between - $2670 (Inside Cabin) to $5000 (Balcony) per person (with taxs and port fees) as a group rate and we want to give everyone a chance to save up. We will also try to keep costs down.
We will also be working with a personal cruise consultant that will set us up for a great time. We will only have room for 12 members on this crusie.
To learn more about this once in a life time crusie, join us for our onlinesession.

Hardware quantum computers are supposed to potentially facilitate the encoding of the full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunction of the many-electron molecular system thanks to entangled quantum bits or qubits. In classical computers, implementing the FCI scales exponentially with the number of electrons and the number of spin-orbitals, which makes the manipulation and storage of the wavefunction inefficient. However, using a quantum computer, we can instead store the (FCI) wavefunction by using only orbitals which correspond to number of qubits. This potential quantum advantage has recently excited both hardware and software communities generating rapid progresses in the field. Variational Quantum Eigen solver (VQE) is a potential algorithm-well suited for its practical implementation on present Noisy Intermediate Scaled Quantum (NISQ) devices.
The proposal presentation focuses on the development of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) through an opensoure OpenVQE, covering the latest advancements, circuit measurement techniques, and the computational demands of quantum computers. The process of VQE is hybrid, consists of quantum circuits state and classical parameter optimization, and it aims to find the ground state of a given molecular Hamiltonian. Particularly, we will concentrate on advanced quantum chemistry methods such as Unitary Coupled Cluster that involves Single and Double excitations (UCCSD) has recently attracted interest due to its use in VQE molecular simulations on NISQ device. Furthermore, we want to introduce, an algorithm termed Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT)-VQE to build system-adapted ansatze with substantially fewer variational parameters. This section of the talk will introduce and compare two similar dynamically created ansatze(fermionic-ADAPT-VQE and qubit-ADAPT-VQE), and compare computational efficiency of ADAPT-VQE against UCCSD-VQE.

***
The Civil Waris a 1990 American television documentary miniseries created byKen Burnsabout the American Civil War. It was the first broadcast to air on PBS for five consecutive nights, from September 23 to 27, 1990.More than 39 million viewers tuned in to at least one episode, and viewership averaged more than 14 million viewers each evening, making it the most-watched program ever to air on PBS. It was awarded more than 40 major television and film honors. A companion book to the documentary was released shortly after the series aired.The film's production techniques were groundbreaking for the time, and spawned film techniques such as the Ken Burns effect. Its theme song, ""Ashokan Farewell"" is widely acclaimed. The series was extremely influential, and serves as the main source of knowledge about the Civil War to many Americans. However, some historians have criticized the film for not delving into the subsequent, racially contentious Reconstruction era, and having an all-white production team.The series was rebroadcast in June 1994 as a lead-up to Burns's next series Baseball, then remastered for its 12th anniversary in 2002, although it remained in standard definition resolution. To commemorate the film's 25th anniversary and the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War and Lincoln's assassination, the film underwent a complete digital restoration to high-definition format in 2015.

(1987) 鈥� Movie Discussion,Online,"The first film in Abbas Kiarostami鈥檚 sublime, interlacing ""Koker Trilogy"" takes a simple premise 鈥� a boy searches for the home of his classmate, whose all-important notebook he has accidentally taken 鈥� and transforms it into a miraculous child鈥檚-eye adventure of the everyday. As our young hero zigzags determinedly across two towns, aided (and sometimes misdirected) by those he encounters, his quest becomes both a revealing portrait of rural Iranian society in all its richness and complexity and a touching parable about the meaning of personal responsibility. Sensitive and profound,Where Is the Friend鈥檚 House?is shot through with all the beauty, tension, and wonder a single day can contain.
""Like the neo-realist works from which it descends, deceptively simple and utterly profound."" (Rotten Tomatoes)
""Kiarostami represents the highest level of artistry in the cinema."" (Martin Scorcese)
""A classic of humanist filmmaking and a landmark in Iranian cinema."" (TIFF: Toronto International Film Festival)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's revisit Abbas Kiarostami and discuss his 1987 filmWhere Is the Friend鈥檚 House?(Persian: 禺丕賳賴 丿賵爻鬲 讴噩丕爻鬲), recently votedthe 72nd greatest movie of all timein Sight & Sound's international survey of filmmakers, andthe 157th greatest of all timein the related poll of film critics and experts. The film, inspired by a poem by Iranian poet Sohrab Sepehri, was one of Kiarostami's most successful films in Iran and his first film to gain major international attention.
The film is the first installment of Kiarostami's so-called ""Koker Trilogy"", which Criterion has called ""a gradual outward zoom revealing the cosmic majesty and mystery of ordinary life."" We will watch the other two installments at later meetups. We previously discussed 3 other films by Kiarostami:Close-Up(1989),Taste of Cherry(1997), andThe Wind Will Carry Us(1999).
Please watch the movie in advance and bring your thoughts, reactions, and queries to share with us at the meeting.

However, few know that there are other spiritual laws such as the Law of Consciousness, the Law of Economy, the Law of Reversed Effort, and the Law of Non-interference. You can learn how to shape your life and your destiny to be in harmony with these laws. A knowledge of these laws can give you the resources you need to make the very best decision at any one moment.
According to ECK Master Harold Klemp, ""Everything in life is about change. Yet it is mostly your ability to change your consciousness to the needs of the moment that counts above all"" (The Spiritual Laws of Life, p. 5).
Come to share your spiritual experiences and questions in this free and open discussion. See how your own life has often reflected these spiritual laws in examples from daily life situations. Try a spiritual technique to bring you in harmony with Spirit and open you to spiritual guidance in any situation. We will also do a brief review of the Law of Attraction or the Law of Attitudes. We always have a great conversation--bring a friend!

Anyone studying to be in the UX field, or already in the field, is welcome to participate. Spaces are limited, so early registration is encouraged. There will be a wait list.
Thank you to our UXPA NJ team lead, Lauren Dillard, who has enrolled a great team of reviewers. They are eager to provide you with useful and actionable feedback. We look forward to hearing their suggestions and recommendations. Please read their biographies below and see for yourself.
Here's the plan:Attendees will prepare their portfolios in advance and have the link to their portfolio ready for sharing at the start of the event. After welcomes and introductions, etc., attendees will be assigned to a small group of at least three people, plus at least one of our expert reviewers. During the first hour, we anticipate three portfolio reviews, each one twenty minutes in length. After the first round/hour, resources permitting, our reviewers may review two additional portfolios, which will take approximately forty minutes (twenty minutes each). Following the shorter, second round, we'll all get back together in the main room, share closing remarks and observations, and close out the event.
Note:Be prepared to answer a few questions about your portfolio, even before the reviewer takes a look at it. For example, your reviewer may ask you about the job title you are seeking to fill, and how many years of related experience you have. Being prepared to answer these questions ahead of time will assist your reviewer, and will help ensure that you get the most value out of the experience.

A lot of Stoic theory gets lost in translation. One common example is translatingareteas ""virtue""-- an English word that carries connotations that the ancient word doesn't have. But the poor mapping between modern concepts and ancient Stoic ones doesn't stop there.
In this meetup, we'll discuss a paper from scholar Tad Brennan who argues other modern moral notions don't map onto ancient Stoic ethics well. Specifically, Brennan argues:

This time around we are reading the book: Michel Foucault's Archaeology of Scientific Reason: Science and the History of Reason (1989) by Gary Gutting
The format will be similar to our usual""accelerated live read"". What this means is that each participant will be expected to read roughly 20-30 pages of text before each session. Each participant will have the option of picking a few paragraphs they especially want to focus on. We will then do a live read on the paragraphs that the participants found most interesting when they did the assigned reading.
As always, this meetup will be 3 hours.During the first 2 hours we will talk in a very focused way on the chapter we have read. During this part of the meetup,only people who have done the reading will be allowed to influence the direction of the conversation.So please do the reading if you intend to speak during the first 2 hours of this meetup. You might think this does not apply to you, but it does! It applies to you.
During the last hour(which we call ""The Free for All"") people can talk about absolutely anything related to philosophy. People who have not done the reading will be allowed (and encouraged!) to direct the conversation during this third hour.
Foucault wrote on a wide range of topics. During the first 2 hours of the meetup, we will only talk about his views on Science and the History of Science. I realize this may not be the most popular part of his work, but it is the part we are talking about. During the ""Free for All"" we can talk about other aspects of his work including the popular parts.
Reading Schedule
Please note that in this meetup we will be actuallydoingphilosophy and not merely absorbing Foucault's ideas in a passive way. What this means is that we will be trying to find flaws in Foucault's reasoning and in his mode of presenting his ideas. We will also be trying to improve the ideas in question and perhaps proposing better alternatives. That is what philosophers do after all!
About the Book:
This is an important introduction to and critical interpretation of the work of the major French thinker, Michel Foucault. Through comprehensive and detailed analyses of such important texts asThe History of Madness in the Age of Reason,The Birth of the Clinic,The Order of Things, andThe Archaeology of Knowledge, the author provides a lucid exposition of Foucault's ""archaeological"" approach to the history of thought, a method for uncovering the ""unconscious"" structures that set boundaries on the thinking of a given epoch.
The book casts Foucault in a new light, relating his work to Gaston Bachelard's philosophy of science and Georges Canguilhem's history of science. This perspective yields a new and valuable understanding of Foucault as a historian and philosopher of science, balancing and complementing the more common view of him as primarily a social critic and theorist.
Suggestions for Extra Reading
This other book on Foucault is absolutely excellent. I almost picked this book instead of the Gutting. But in the end I decided that the Gutting book would work better in a meetup context since the B茅atrice Han book is quite a bit more difficult and requires that the reader know a lot more about Kant. Challenge yourself and read it on your own.
Any study of Foucault will benefit from a study of Kant however. This book is excellent and gives the reader a good sense of all the ways there are of interpreting Kant:
I had the great good fortune to study Foucault with the late great Canadian Philosopher of Science Ian Hacking whose own work was heavily influenced by Foucault. This book is a study of the history of probability done in a similar way to how Foucault does his histories:
This is a book by Hacking which is inspired by Foucault's approach to the history of madness
NOTE:In this meetup, all technology-related issues are handled by Jen. So, if you cannot get into the meetup or are having other technology-related issues, there is no point contacting Philip. Philip is still trying to master the art of building a phone out of two tin cans and a string! : (
So don't contact Philip about technology, contact Jen instead and get some real answers!",17,Jen and Philip,Entertainment

We will finish up with Part III, and a discussion of the overall book in December.
Here is what the publisher has to say about the book:
""In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history.""

Join us for an online/virtual tour of one of the most popular museums in London -the Churchill War Rooms(aka the Cabinet War Rooms) /Churchill Museum, which is a branch of the Imperial War Museum (which we'll be touring at a later date).Discover the secrets of the Second World War in the underground nerve centre where Churchill and his war cabinet lived and worked.
The Churchill Museumis the first museum dedicated to the life and achievements ofSir Winston Churchill. This permanent exhibition is housed within the unique historic setting of the Cabinet War Rooms, Churchill's secret underground wartime base.We'll also briefly cover Winston Churchill's life, before and after World War II, and what it was like living in London during World War II.Our programme will include slides, videos and commentary on the war rooms (not a live broadcast from the museum because of Covid and other logistics concerns).
The Churchill War Roomsis a museum in London and one of the five branches of the Imperial War Museum. The museum comprises the Cabinet War Rooms, a historic underground complex that housed a British government command centre throughout the Second World War, and the Churchill Museum, a biographical museum exploring the life of British statesman Winston Churchill.Construction of the Cabinet War Rooms, located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, began in 1938. They became fully operational on 27 August 1939, a week before Britain declared war on Germany. The War Rooms remained in operation throughout the Second World War, before being abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan.After the war, the historic value of the Cabinet War Rooms was recognised. Their preservation became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works and later the Department for the Environment, during which time very limited numbers of the public were able to visit by appointment. In the early 1980s, the Imperial War Museum was asked to take over the administration of the site, and the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public in April 1984. The museum was reopened in 2005 following a major redevelopment as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, but in 2010 this title was shortened to the Churchill War Rooms.

Hi! I鈥檓 Fran莽ois, the new organizer of the Travel Tribe MeetUp group. I saw that this group had no organizer and decided to take over and continue the activities.
I was born in Montreal, Canada, I speak English, French, and Spanish, plus bits and pieces of about 4 other languages. My career as a commodities day trader for the past 24 years has given me the flexibility to live and work in places like Spain, Hungary, China, Monaco, Italy, Mexico, and Antigua.
In addition to trading, I鈥檝e been teaching French since 2017, online and in-person. I've given almost 4,000 French language lessons to students based all around the world. Here below is my French teacher's profile on Italki, a language learning platform.

Travel is my passion, and my own wish list includes traveling through Scandinavia in winter, attending an Afrobeat concert series in Africa, taking a road trip along the US West Coast, and spending three months exploring Japan.
I am looking forward to meeting all of you, hear your travel stories, and share inspiration for our future adventures together! See you on December 5th !! 馃専
